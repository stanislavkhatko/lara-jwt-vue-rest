# Instructions for the Test Project

## User Management System

### Objective:

Develop a simple yet robust web application that allows for managing user accounts. This includes functionalities for user registration, login, viewing, editing, and deleting user profiles.

- TDD Framework: PHPUnit or PEST for Laravel

### Requirements

API Development:

- Design and implement RESTful APIs for user management (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Use Laravel to develop these APIs following the TDD approach.
- Ensure API endpoints are secure and accessible only to authenticated users.

### Frontend Development:

- Develop the frontend using Vue.js and Vuetify.
- Implement a login page that authenticates users through the API.
- Create a dashboard for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting users. This should be accessible only to authenticated users.
- Implement form validations on both frontend and backend to ensure data integrity.

### Authentication:

- Implement secure login functionality.
- Use JWT to manage user sessions and protect API routes.

### Testing:

- Write comprehensive unit and feature tests using PHPUnit.
- Tests must cover API endpoints, authentication mechanisms, and front-end interactions.
